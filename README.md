# Molecular modelling toolset.

* [mathlib](mathlib): utility library of mathematical algorithms.
* [chemlib](chemlib): cheminformatics utility library.
* [bokpredict](bokpredict): tool for molecular potential energy prediction with body-ordered kernel machine learning force fields.

## Compile instructions

1. Open solution file `modelling.sln` with Visual Studio 2019 or newer.
1. Build `mathlib`, `chemlib` and `bokpredict` projects in the given order. This is going to produce `bokpredict` executable in the RC subdirectory along with `mathlib.dll` and `chemlib.dll`.
