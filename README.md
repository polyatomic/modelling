# Molecular modelling toolset.

## Mathlib

Utility library of mathematical algorithms.

## Chemlib

Cheminformatics utility library.

## Bokpredict

Tool for molecular potential energy prediction with body-ordered kernel machine learning force fields.

## Compile instructions

1. Open solution file modelling.sln with Visual Studio 2019 or newer.
1. Build mathlib, chemlib and bokpredict projects in the given order. This is going to produce bokpredict executable in the RC subdirectory along with mathlib.dll and chemlib.dll.
